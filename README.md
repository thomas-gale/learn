# learn
A personal, experimental dive learning how to build C++ based machine learning systems.

## Motivation
- I ultimately want to explore the use of deep reinforcement learning to democratise the manufacturing domain (my profession and interest).
- I'm fascinated by the work of Deepmind / David Silver (loved his [UCL lecture series](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/))
- I'm enjoying reading *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction: Sutton, Barto (2018)*
- I'm enjoying reading *Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On: Maxim Lapan (2018)* (I need to get the second edition)
- I think that https://gym.openai.com/ is cool
- I like [bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) as a simulation environement, maybe even try [godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)?
- I'm a fan of the C++ language ❤️ *Bjarne Stroustrup*
- I learn by doing e.g. re-writing things from python -> C++
- PyTorch now has a [wonderful C++ API](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/)
- I want my GPU to do something interesting (other than gaming)
- I want to build the whole thing as a container native / ready to scale (maybe one day...)

## Attribution
- Going to shamelessly use large bits of https://github.com/Omegastick/pytorch-cpp-rl when necessary (such as linked to torch C++ <-> openai gym) (great project)
- Going to shamelessly use large bits of https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan / https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On when necessary (Maxim's book is also motivation)

## Plan
- First, attempt to follow exercises in but rewritten in C++ [Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On: Maxim Lapan (2018)](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On)
- Also, attempt to write bits of [ptan](https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan) in C++
- Finally, do something cool (maybe with [b2a](https://github.com/thomas-gale/bits-to-atoms) - build in a learning agent into the service providers of the virtual factory marketplace with the reward function set to maximise profit...)
